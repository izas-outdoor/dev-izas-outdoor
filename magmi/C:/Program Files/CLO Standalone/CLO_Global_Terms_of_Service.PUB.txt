THIS LIMITATION IS INDEPENDENT OF ANY OTHER LIMITATION SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS.

19.4	IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE Â§1542, WHICH SAYS: A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

19.5	THE CLO PARTIES DO NOT ENDORSE AND ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY OF ANY OPINION, ADVICE OR STATEMENT, NOR FOR ANY OFFENSIVE, DEFAMATORY, OBSCENE OR ILLEGAL POSTING OR CONDUCT, ON OUR SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, BY ANYONE OTHER THAN AUTHORIZED CLO EMPLOYEES WHILE ACTING IN THEIR OFFICIAL CAPACITIES.

20.	Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold CLO Parties harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your use of our Services or CLO Software in violation of these Terms and/or any breach of your representations and warranties set forth above and/or if content you Post causes us to be liable to another.

21.	Equitable Remedies
You acknowledge that the rights granted and obligations made under these Terms to CLO are of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which shall irreparably harm CLO and which cannot be replaced by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, CLO shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligations of posting any bond or surety or proof of damages) in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you.
You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief, or to enjoin or restrain the operation of our Services, exploitation of any advertising or other materials issued in connection therewith, or exploitation of our Services or any content or other material used or displayed through our Services and agree to limit your claims to monetary damages (but only to the extent permissible under these Terms).
22.	Disputes
22.1	You are contracting with CLO Virtual Fashion, LLC located at 79 Madison Ave, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10016 USA. The laws of the State of New York, USA govern the interpretation of these Terms and apply to claims for breach of these Terms, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The parties specifically exclude from application to these Terms the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act. All other claims, including claims regarding consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort, will, only to the extent required by applicable law, be subject to the laws of your state of residence in the United States, or, if you live outside the United States, the laws of the country in which you reside. You and we irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts for New York County, New York, USA, for all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms.

22.2	Any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of our Services or these Terms must be filed within 1 year after such claim or cause or action arose regardless of any statutes or law to the contrary. In the event any such claim or cause of action is not filed within such 1 year period, such claim or cause of action are forever barred.

22.3	For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief shall resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. The party requesting relief shall initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, and the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (b) all aspects of the arbitration shall be conducted in the English language; (c) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (d) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

22.4	All claims you bring against CLO must be resolved in accordance with this Section. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Section shall be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Section, CLO shall be entitled to recover attorneys' fees and costs up to $2,000, provided that CLO has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.

23.	Severability

The provisions of these Terms are intended to be severable. If for any reason any provision of these Terms shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions hereof in any jurisdiction.

24.	ENFORCEABILITY, ENTIRE AGREEMENT & NON-WAIVER

These Terms are deemed accepted upon any use of our Services. These Terms and any additional terms referenced herein constitute the entire agreement between you and CLO regarding the use of our Services. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.

25.	ASSIGNMENT

You may not transfer or assign any of the rights or licenses granted to you hereunder without our prior written consent therefor. However, we may transfer or assign all or a part of our rights or responsibilities under these Terms to any person or entity without your consent.

26.	FORCE MAJEURE

We are not liable for any changes or problems out of our control, for example changes or problems caused by like natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, network infrastructure failures, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.
