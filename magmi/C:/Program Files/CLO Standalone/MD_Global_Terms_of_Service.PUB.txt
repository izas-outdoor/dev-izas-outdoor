The Receiving Party agrees that it will take the same steps to protect the confidentiality of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information as it takes to protect its own proprietary and confidential information. The Receiving Party shall protect and keep confidential and shall not use, publish or otherwise disclose to any third party, except as contemplated by this Agreement or with the Disclosing Party's prior written consent, the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information during and after the term of this Agreement.

For purposes of this Agreement, Confidential Information shall not include such information that:

(a)  was known to the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure of it to the receiving Party by the Disclosing Party hereunder; or

(b)  was generally available to the public or was otherwise part of the public domain at the time of disclosure or became generally available to the public or otherwise part of the public domain after disclosure other than through any act or omission of the Receiving Party in breach of this Agreement; or

(c)  became known to the Receiving Party after disclosure from a source that had a lawful right to disclose such information to others; or

(d)  was independently developed by the Receiving Party where such independent development can be established by written documentation.

30.2 Permitted Disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party and/or the terms and conditions of this Agreement pursuant to a subpoena or other court process only (i) after having given the Disclosing Party prompt notice of the Receiving Party's receipt of such subpoena or other process and (ii) after the Receiving Party has given the Disclosing Party a reasonable opportunity to oppose such subpoena or other process or to obtain a protective order. Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in the custody or control of the Receiving Party shall be promptly returned or destroyed upon the earlier of (i) the Disclosing Party's written request or (ii) termination of these Terms.

30.3 Term.  The obligations of the Receiving Party under this Section 30 shall survive, with respect to any particular Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, until all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party disclosed hereunder becomes publicly known or made generally available through no action or inaction of the Receiving Party; except with respect to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party that constitutes a trade secret under applicable law, in which case, such obligations of the Receiving Party shall continue until such Confidential Information becomes publicly known or made generally available through no action or inaction of the Receiving Party..

30.4 Remedies.  The Receiving Party agrees that any violation or threatened violation of this Agreement may cause irreparable injury to the Disclosing Party, entitling the Disclosing Party to seek injunctive relief in addition to all legal remedies.
