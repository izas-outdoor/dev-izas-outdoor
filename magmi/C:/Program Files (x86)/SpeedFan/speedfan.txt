What it does:
SpeedFan is a freeware program that monitors fan speeds and temperatures in computers with
a known monitoring chip. Its main feature is that it can control the speed of the fans
according to the temperatures inside your pc, thus reducing noise and power consumption.
SpeedFan can also access S.M.A.R.T. data and temperatures from EIDE, SATA and SCSI hard
disks (connected in several RAID setups too).

Disclaimer:
SpeedFan has been thoroughly tested, but you should know that low level access to the
hardware of a PC can lead to unexpected results.

How to setup:
Use the installer and read the HELP FILE.

     - added support for SMSC Hardware Monitoring Block
     - LPC47M15X and LPC49M192 can't be distinguished (according to what available
       datasheets say) and, therefore, all references to previous LPC47M15X detection
       have been converted to LPC47M192

4.06 - changed detection routine for MAX1617
     - properly detected and handled SiS961
     - completely rewritten the configuration file. This is a major update I've been
       working on for a long time. This new configuration file properly handles
       computers where hardware monitoring devices appear and disappear and/or are
       swapped out (like S.M.A.R.T. HDDs).
       You should consider deleting SPEEDFANSENS.CFG before running this new release.
     - refined the configuration file: now it stores advanced properties set in the
       configuration dialog (ADVANCED tab)
     - ADVANCED configuration supports IT8712F temperature sensors mode
     - ADVANCED configuration supports IT8693F, IT8702F and IT8712F fan divisors
     - added full support for W83637HF
     - slightly revisited S.M.A.R.T. window to better show info reported by HDs with
       a lot of attributes
     - S.M.A.R.T. attributes are now shown with an icon telling the status of
       individual relevant attributes (STOP below 10%, WARNING below 40% and OK
       otherwise). Other attributes are only informative and an icon has no reason to
       be :-)
     - added support for SIS645DX (the one on ASUS P4S533)
     - fixed MTP008 PWMs and voltages readings
     - added full support for SIS650
     - fixed hibernation support
     - added MAX6650 PWM support
     - properly handled reversed logic PWM used on IT8712F
     - added full support for ADM1032

     - SEND REPORT now asks for basic info on fan speed changing ability for your
       motherboard
     - updated the help file for S.M.A.R.T.
     - fixed a minor problem with the REMEMBER IT checkbox in the ADVANCED tab of the
       CONFIGURATION dialog
     - user selected properties for each sensor chip are properly restored after SUSPEND
     - updated the help file for the INFO tab
     - added preliminary support for W83L785R
     - finally managed to enable ADM1025 monitoring!
     - forced IT8693F starting monitoring, if needed
     - added preliminary ASUS VIDEO CARDs support under Win2K/XP (you need the latest
       version of SmartDoctor installed)
     - added an SMBUS DEBUG facility activated by using /SMBDEBUG command line switch
       (there is a full description of this feature in the help file)
     - WANTED and WARNING temperatures shown in CONFIGURATION dialog are now shown both
       in Celsius and in Fahrenheit
     - finally fixed MSI KT3 Ultra hanging while scanning SMBus

     - added preliminary detection for LM90
4.05 - added full support for SIS635, SIS645, SIS735, SIS740 and SIS745. This
       means, for example, that you can read values from your ASUS P4S333 :-)
     - added support for FSB changing. Currently there are only a few motheboards
       and PLLs that are supported. On my ABIT BP6, LUCKY STAR 6LX2 and ECS K7S5A
       it's working pretty fine :-)
     - WINBOND W83791SD is now properly detected, thus avoiding detection of
       unknown chips at the same address
     - those two buttons in the CONFIG dialog should now properly show even with
       large fonts
     - added context-sensitive help (available pressing F1) which includes the
       tutorial

       registry
     - added some new code to better reset Intel SMBus
     - added some tips that can be disabled after their first appearance
     - added preliminary ADM1024 support (please, send reports)
4.04 - created full installer/uninstaller
     - completely removed DLPORTIO
     - the installer can remove the DLPORTIO service if it was previously installed
     - documentation has been moved to CHM format and so it no longer requires
       WORD :-)

     - full support for MAX6657 and MAX6659
     - trying to avoid duplicated detection of the W83627HF on TYANs
     - fixed an error that caused the PERFORMANCE indicator for S.M.A.R.T. drives
       to return too high a value if nothing was wrong (this error is mostly
       cosmetic and nobody could see it, as it was rounded to 100% even if it was,
       internally, reporting 10000% :-))
     - added full support for ALi M1535D/D+ fan control
     - added support for FDC37N972

     - moved INI to the registry so that restricted users can use it under NT/2K/XP
     - fixed W83L784R voltage readings
4.02 - new detection routine for WINBOND chips
     - fixed a bug in the CONFIGURATION dialog that prevented some users from
       accessing all available options when using large fonts on some video cards
     - by popular demand, I've added online a list of motherboards that are know
       to change fan speeds
     - restored and verified full support for W83697HF PWMs. I managed to figure
       out how to use them by walking through those million errors on the
       datasheet :-)
     - previous releases could issue a "WARNING : GIVEIO.SYS not started" without
       informing that the following second attempt actually succeeded. Now
       everything is more informative :-)
     - fixed a bug when too many temperatures are detected
     - added preliminary handling of specific sensors' options (you can find them,
       for a few Winbond sensor chips, in the configuration dialog under the
       ADVANCED tab)
     - added support for ALi M1535D+ from ALi Cyber ALADDiN
     - added support for DELL CPU temperature and for fan speeds, even if these
       readings are the result of some hacks and not the result of a public
       datasheet. Any info from DELL would be much appreciated. Anyway, please
       note that reported temperatures seem to be REALLY HIGH. I wouldn't play with
       fan speeds if not absolutely sure. But so many of you asked for DELL
       support, so... now you should have it :-)
     - configuration option named ENABLE DELL FANS has been changed to ENABLE DELL
       SUPPORT
     - added detection and full support for MC1066
     - S.M.A.R.T. temperatures are now read every minute
     - all readings are forcibly updated after any configuration change
     - fixed CPU USAGE under Win9x
     - added full support for ALi M5879
     - removed a false detection of an LPC47b37x that may happen sometimes when a
       W83627HF is actually there
     - added preliminary detection for LPC47M15X (PLEASE REPORT)
     - added preliminary detection for EMC6D100/EMC6D101 (PLEASE REPORT)

       and performance
     - added preliminary support for PC87360
     - added preliminary support for PC87363
     - added a new command line parameter (/TIGERMP) to add full support for TYAN
       TigerMP
     - fixed a bug when associating PWMs that could lead to a DEBUG message
     - added /NOTIMER command line parameter that will avoid SpeedFan from updating
       values. This option is useful to see if SpeedFan is able to properly detect
       your hardware and stop right after having done that
     - added /NOSMARTSCAN command line parameter. This option will force SpeedFan
       not to probe S.M.A.R.T. devices. This is useful if you're having problems at
       program startup right after HD probing. This has occurred a couple of times
       and the reason should be in a bad driver for the HD controller
     - fixed "PROCESSOR PERFORMANCE OBJECT NOT FOUND" error. Now it is trapped and
       a nice message is displayed. CPU usage won't be available, but everything
       else will be
     - decoded some additional info about DIMMs
     - added preliminary support for ServerWorks OSB4 (I need reports)
     - added preliminary support for WINBOND W83L784 (I need reports here, as
       datasheets, guess what?, are incomplete, missing or full of errors :-))
4.01 - the last PWM (SPEED) can be properly set once again (thank you Sander for
       making me notice it :-))
     - added an option to choose between CELSIUS and FAHRENHEIT when showing
       temperatures
4.00 - properly reported IT8712F voltages
     - SMBus support is enabled on some VIA686 revisions if disabled
     - added SiS5595 sensor support
     - properly reported IT8693F voltages
     - CPU USAGE is now shown on the main window and supports multiprocessor
       systems too
     - added CPU speed computation (it works only for processors after and
       including Pentium I, but it appears to be extremely precise :-))
     - minimum and maximum fan SPEED settings are now selectable in 1 increments
     - reported samples now show their measure units
     - the balloon hint now appears only when a different sensors set is detected
     - fixed initial reporting about IT8693F settings
     - added preliminary support for FDC37n972
     - added full support for SIS630 SMBus
     - added full support for SiS730 SMBus
     - the message "ISA seems to be unused" has been changed to type INFO,
       instead of WARNING because several of you were afraid about the message
       itself :-)
     - added support for PC87364 PWMs
     - added support for PC87366 PWMs
     - fixed detection and usage of VT8231 and VT8233 SMBus
     - slightly changed SEND REPORT when probing SMBus
     - on the main window, the EXIT button has been replaced by MINIMIZE

       everything is in sync with the datasheet)
     - added support for S.M.A.R.T. drives that report temperatures
     - added a TAB with S.M.A.R.T. info
     - enabled temperature monitoring on PC87366 if in standby
     - enabled S.M.A.R.T. monitoring for those HDs that have got it disabled
     - completely rewritten tray icon support
     - tray icon background and text colors are now fully configurable
     - IT8705/IT8712 voltages' readings are now enabled if BIOS didn't
3.07 - I've completely rewritten the installation procedure.
       Actually, now, there is none :-)
       You should no longer need to put any needed file nowhere, as SpeedFan is
       able to recreate them on the fly :-)
     - DLPORTIO.SYS and DLPORTIO.DLL need not to be manually put anywhere as
       SpeedFan should be able to recreate them if missing
     - fixed a bug with label when disabling ALL fans or ALL temps or ALL voltages
       or ALL speeds; if you try to reproduce this bug, please remember to check
       the fans each temperature is supposed to use; please note that this is not
       a bug in my code, but a "feature" from the compiler :-)
     - fixed an exception when sending a report using WinXP
     - GIVEIO.SYS needs not to be manually put anywhere as SpeedFan should be able
       to recreate it if missing, to install it as a service (under NT, 2k, XP) if
       not yet done and to start it if stopped :-)
     - autoinstalled GIVEIO.SYS if needed
     - changed icons: I know I'm not good with graphics, but I hope you will
       appreciate the effort :-) By the way: drawing a fan with THOSE 16 colors is
       not that easy :-)
     - /SUPERIO command line parameter has been removed: now SuperIO detection
       starts by default (I've done several tests with no reported crash :-)). If
       you need to disable SuperIO detection, use the /NOSUPERIO parameter instead
     - startup SMBus detection is now much faster; it you realize that some of
       your sensors are not properly detected, please use the /SLOWDETECT command
       line parameter and let me know
     - current PWM values (speeds) are updated after RESUME
     - confirmed full support for variating fan speeds with SMSC LPC47M13X
     - added preliminary detection for a lot of new SMSC and NATIONAL SuperIO 
       chips
     - fixed MTP008 fan speed reporting
     - fixed an error with PWM readings from ADM1021
     - redesigned the REPORT PREVIEW dialog
     - the report sends info about the SMBus (I've created this test in order to
       be able to create a faster startup sensor detection; PLEASE SEND AS MANY
       REPORTS AS POSSIBLE)
     - ADM1025 properly initialized if not yet enabled
     - fixed ADM9240, DS1780 and LM81 initialization
     - fixed a problem when setting PWMs
     - reversed PWM max and min logic on IT8712F: the datasheet says nothing on
       this subject, so I had to guess :-)
     - ADM9240, DS1780 and LM81 are properly initialized if not yet enabled
     - minor debugging changes to INTEL and VIA SMBus routines
     - added preliminary detection for FMS2701 (PLEASE REPORT)
3.08 - restored the proper use of MUTEXes: this should fix the problems when
       running SF together with other hardware monitoring softwares. I don't know
       how it could happen, but the compiler put an "END." in the wrong place,
       thus removing my INITIALIZATION routine
     - W83601R now properly reports its revision
     - trying to detect IT8703F
     - added full support for ALi M1533 South Bridge
     - the report now includes an ISA scan

     - trying to access LPC47N252 PWMs
     - preliminary MAX6650 fan speed reporting
     - added support for DELL NOTEBOOKS. If you can't variate fan speeds with
       the controls on the main window, you might try to check the DELL option
       in the configuration dialog. This is actually something that works on
       DELLs, but there is no official info on this subject. It is based on a
       research from Michael Henze. It has been successfully tested on Latitude
       CPi D266XT and Inspiron 8000. Please, let me know if it works on your DELL
     - better detection of problems when sending reports
     - GL518SM should be fixed at last! this chip drove me crazy, but I found a
       PC with it and, finally, understood what was causing the problem :-)
     - added preliminary MAX6655 detection (PLEASE REPORT)
     - revised VIA SMBus support
     - added full support for LPC47N252 PWMs (tested on a DELL INSPIRON 8000,
       even though it's not that useful as I was unable to find any temperature
       sensor...)
     - trying to enable PMU on ALi M1533, M1543 and M1535D/D+ if not yet enabled
     - WINBOND has informed me that W83697HF has got no PWM :-(
     - added support for PC87364 and PC87366 fan speed readings
3.06 - complete SMBus support for VIA VT8233 M2
 b1  - rewritten ALi1543 detection
     - revised ALi SMBus access

       detection
     - slightly speeded up SMBus transactions on INTEL and ALi
     - fixed a RANGE CHECK ERROR
     - SMBus failed transactions are now retried when they first fail
     - written a DOC to illustrate how to configure SpeedFan :-)
     - I've been told (thank you Alfred!) that on "ASUS A7V266, rev 1.06, BIOS
       v1002" you need to set CPU THERMAL OPTION, in your BIOS, to SHUTDOWN in
       order for SpeedFan to be able to variate fan speeds. Let me know about your
       experience :-)
3.04 - changed the order of detection for some sensors
b8.5 - no longer displayed AS99127F -5V and -12V readings
     - fixed GL518SM and GL520SM detection
     - added full support for GL518SM
     - VIA686 sensor chip now reports a few more data in the REPORT
     - added a BALLOON HINT at program startup (you need at least Win2k or Me I
       think)
     - I hope the tray icon is ok now :-)
     - default minimum value for fan speeds is now set to 0%
     - fan speeds are no longer variated as a default (you must enable them); I
       had to set it this way because a lot of users reported they couldn't change
       fan speeds, but it was due to the fact that SF was restoring them to
       appropriate values (according to temperature readings)
     - if a sensor is detected on ISA and then found again on SMBus, that SMBus
       address is no longer probed for other sensors
     - tried to distinguish between VIA686A and VIA686B
     - LM80 detection is delayed if all others fail
     - added a CONFIG option to start SPEEDFAN minimized
     - fixed an occasional bug in VIA TEMPs' readings (RANGE CHECK ERROR)
     - VIA686 is handled properly on a Soltek SL-75KAV, thanx to Janko Laszlo :-)
     - this version should work fine on every motherboard with VIA686
     - fixed a minor bug with AS99127F that was introduced with an internal beta
       release :-)
     - rewritten decoding of WINBOND and ASUS chips; I hope they are all fine now
     - added support for the fourth PWM register available in Winbond's W83782D
     - added support for forced suspension (when no confirmation is asked to
       running programs)
     - SEND REPORT sends some additional info about which is your operating system
       and your CPU
     - beta test with a SOLTEK motherboard
     - all readings show a hint with their last, minimum, maximum and mean value
     - main window no longer shows double values (last and mean)
     - added register reporting for unknown WINBOND chips
     - added '/NOSMBSCAN' command line option to solve problems with those
       motherboards where SMBus contains some chips that hang the system when read
       from (like some SOLTEKs)
     - fixed a problem when too many sensors' reading were available (more than
       those that could be shown)
     - added full support for ADM1025
     - added fans' and pwms' readings for LPC47b27x
     - added '/SUPERIO' command line option to enable detection of LPC47xxxx
       SuperIO chips with integrated hardware monitoring capabilities

       speeds (useful for those of you with CPUs that change their temperature very
       quickly)
